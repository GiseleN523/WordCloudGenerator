Orono won the final Class A quarterfinal of the day in a thrilling 2-1 overtime victory over Northfield on Wednesday at the Xcel Energy Center. Senior Avery Anderson deflected a shot from teammate Brody Finnegan into the back of the net to win the game and advance on to the semifinals.

The goal came with just 30.2 seconds left on the game clock and just past 11 p.m.

The first goal of the game was a bit of a fluke, as Orono’s Bradley Walker shot from down low at a sharp angle, then a Northfield player accidentally tipped the puck into the back of his own net. The Raiders answered just 66 seconds later as sophomore Griffin Kennelly popped in a goal from just in front of the crease off a pass from junior captain Kamden Kaiser.

The No. 4 Spartans will play No. 1-seeded Warroad in the semifinals on Friday at 1 p.m. at the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul.

Northfield goaltender Keaton Walock made an impressive 48 saves, while Orono’s Brock Peyton posted 23.
